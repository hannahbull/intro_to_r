# Pre-class preparation

## Download MiKTeX or TexLive

You will need to download MiKTeX or TexLive for this class.

Windows: MiKTeX (Complete) - http://miktex.org/2.9/setup
(NOTE: Be sure to download the Complete rather than Basic installation)

Mac OS X: TexLive 2013 (Full) - http://tug.org/mactex/
(NOTE: Downloading with Safari rather than Chrome is strongly recommended)

Linux: `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`

## Test that you can create a pdf R Markdown file

1. Install package `knitr` (command `install.packages("knitr")`) 
2. Click File -> New File -> R Markdown 
3. Choose PDF output 

![Choose PDF output](Data/images/rmarkdown.png)  

4. Save file (file extension is .rmd)
5. Click `Knit` (at the top of the window)  

![Click Knit](Data/images/knit.png)  


6. You should then see a pdf file open. If not, read the error messages and try to resolve the problem. We are also here to help!
