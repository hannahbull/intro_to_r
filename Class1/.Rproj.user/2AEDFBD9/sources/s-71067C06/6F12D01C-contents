# Today's exercise

We will use the tidyverse to extract and transform sociodemographic data of local areas in Paris. At the end of the class, we will produce maps of the 1000 IRISes in Paris, coloured by sociodemographic variables. For example, we will able to see which areas of Paris have the highest number of qualified professionals, the highest number of immigrants, or the highest number of young people. 

# Introduction

There are many different libraries in the R universe for a wide variety of tasks. In this first class, we will be covering methods to import and transform data in R using the `tidyverse`.

## R projects and structuring your code

R projects are good for managing your data and scripts in a particular folder on your computer. Using R-Studio, click File -> New project to create a new R project in a new or existing folder. A good name for a new folder is something like "Class1", which you can save somewhere logical on your computer, such as in a folder called "Introdution_to_R".

Within the folder "Class1", create 3 subfolders, "Data", "Scripts" and "Output". We will save all R code in the folder "Scripts". A key advantage of using R projects is that all paths leading to our input data and output files will be relative to the location of the R project (the folder "Class1").

Create a new R script by clicking File -> New file -> R Script. This should be saved in the folder "Scripts". You can call this script something like "cleaning_paris_data".

## Commenting code

It is always a good idea to comment lines of code. Use `#` at the start of a line in order place a comment or in order to disactivate the line so that it does not run. 

## Installing packages 

Installing packages in R is done with the command `install.packages("package_name")`. To install the tidyverse package, we can thus type `install.packages("tidyverse")`. Once the package has been installed, it needs to be loaded every session using the code `library("package_name")`. Thus, the first lines of our script will be:

```{r installtidyverse, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
### Installing and loading packages
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
```

A useful piece of code to install packages only if they are not already installed, then load them, is:

```{r installifnotinstalled, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
### installs if necessary and loads tidyverse and readxl
### readxl is a package which is part of the tidyverse but not part of the core tidyverse loaded with library("tidyverse")
list.of.packages <- c("tidyverse", "readxl")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages, repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

invisible(lapply(list.of.packages, library, character.only = TRUE))
```

# Reading data 

All the data for today's exercise can be downloaded from here (ADD LINK). Although I provide sources, you do not need to download the data from a given source. 

For this exercise, we use the French population data at the IRIS level (50k units in metropolitan France) that can be downloaded from the [Insee website](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2386737). 

This data is in the form of an excel spreadsheet. This can be read using the tidyverse package `readxl`. This package is not part of the core tidyverse and is not loaded with `library("tidyverse")`. 

```{r readingxl, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
df <- read_csv("../Data/")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
